# Contributing to This Project

Thanks for taking a look at my project! This is a personal hobby/side project I work on in my spare time. It’s not designed with collaboration in mind, but I’m happy to accept contributions if you’d like to submit a pull request (PR)—I appreciate anyone willing to build on what I've done already!

## About This Project

As a side project, here’s what you might encounter:

- **Documentation**: It could be minimal, rough, or outdated
- **Codebase**: Expect some rough edges—unpolished code, potential bugs, or bits that might need tweaking to run.
- **Maintenance**: I’ll review issues and PRs as quickly as I can, though you may have to wait a little while until I can get to it

## How to Contribute

If you’d like to contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Make your own copy to work on.
2. **Make Changes**: Fix bugs, add features, or whatever you wish
3. **Test if You Can**: No big testing demands, but a quick check that it works is great.
4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Send a PR with a short note about your changes. I’ll check it out when I can.

I don’t usually enforce strict coding styles or commit rules (though some projects use git-commit hooks), and I may tweak things during merge to match as appropriate.
## Contribution Ideas

I’m open to things like:

- Bug fixes or stability tweaks.
- New features or additions.
- Doc updates or code cleanup.

## Expectations

As a hobby, this project doesn’t come with guarantees—PRs might not get merged right away, and not every issue will get a quick fix. If something sits for a while, it’s not personal, and you’re welcome to keep building on your fork.

Thanks for considering a contribution!
